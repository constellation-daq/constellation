# Implementing a new Satellite in Python

This how-to guide will walk through the implementation of a new satellite, written in Python, step by step.
It is recommended to have a peek into the overall [concept of satellites](/manual/concepts/satellite) in Constellation in
order to get an impression of which functionality of the application could fit into which state of the finite state machine.

```{note}
This how-to describes the procedure of implementing a new satellite for Constellation in Python. For C++ look [here](/manual/howtos/satellite_cxx) and
for the microcontroller implementation, please refer to the [MicroSat project](https://gitlab.desy.de/constellation/microsat/).
